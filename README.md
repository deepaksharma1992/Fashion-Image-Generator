# Fashion-Image-Generator
This repository contains GAN model to generate fashion data from FASHION-MINST dataset.

This project is 6th week assignment submission for Siraj Make Money with ML course.

This project is built on the FASHION-MINST dataset provided by Kaggle dataset, we created an Generator and Discriminator neural network
which will generate new fashion designs from the exixting datasets.
This is an semi supervised problem where we can generate new designs for fashion industry and serve our users with new creativity.

To run this project, run the Fashion_Generator.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using either Pthon 2 or 3 environment.

AI models used in this datasets are-
1. GAN Model to generate fashion datas


Techonlogies Used in This Project
1. Keras- Dataset, Convolution Neural Network, Sequential Model 
2. Matplotlib and seaborn
3. Numpy for matrix manipulation
